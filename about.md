This is a space intended to document things I love, things I learn and everything in between. I work in tech, am interested in politics and language, and I enjoy food, books and music like most people. I would not classify myself as an expert in everything I love to learn about so instead of being a polymath, I make the much weaker assertion that I am just a ***philomath***, a lover of learning. I foolishly dream of the day I can call myself an expert in all the things I love, but to dull the blow of uncomfortable self-deprecation, I will call it ***phoolish***ness instead of foolishness. پھول (*p<sup>h</sup>ool*) means *flower* in my mothertongue, Urdu, and some other things I really love include floral patterns, bad puns and my heritage.
