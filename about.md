This is a space intended to document the never-ending learning process that is existing and having some interests. I work in the tech industry, I have a degree in math and a strong interest in language and history, and I enjoy all the things that most people enjoy like food, books and music. Far from being a polymath, I make the much weaker assertion that I am simply a ***philomath***, a lover of learning. I foolishly dream of the day I can call myself an expert in all the things I love to learn about, but to dull the blow of uncomfortable self-deprecation, I will call it ***phoolish***ness instead of foolishness. پھول (*p<sup>h</sup>ool*) {% sidenote side1 The superscripted 'h' on the letter 'p' is following the IPA standard for [aspirated consonants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirated_consonant). The 'p' has to pronounced with a puff of air. %} means *flower* in my mothertongue, Urdu, and some other things I really love include floral patterns, bad puns and my heritage.
