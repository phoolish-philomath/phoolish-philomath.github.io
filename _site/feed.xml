        <title>A Real Post? Not Really.</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;The myth of the camel is closely intertwined with the myth of the gas. Indeed, they are offspring borne of the ardent rejection of the censorship surrounding the study of Gavinian anthropology. It is a rebellion and a celebration, a threat and an embrace, a myth but not a legend. Researchers in the field must strive to preserve this history, one that is constantly under threat by the outbreak and rapid spread of a new disease, known to sufferers as &lt;em&gt;maturity&lt;/em&gt;. One may only hope that scientists can find a cure for this gruesome affliction, but till then, we shall continue to fight at the battlefront, so future generations can one day also reminisce about camel myth.&lt;/p&gt;
